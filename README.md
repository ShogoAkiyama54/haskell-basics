# haskell-basics
Basic Haskell syntax and examples learned through [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)

## How to complie and run Haskell code
I use GHC as the book does. Download the Haskell Platform through [here](https://www.haskell.org/platform/).

+ start the interactive mode of GHC: `ghci` at the prompt. 
+ load a haskell file: `:l *filename*` where file name is *filename.hs*
+ reload the current script: `:r`
