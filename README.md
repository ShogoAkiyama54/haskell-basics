# haskell-basics
Basic Haskell syntax and examples learned through [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)

## How to complie and run Haskell code
I use GHC as the book does. Download the Haskell Platform through [here](https://www.haskell.org/platform/).

+ start the interactive mode of GHC: `ghci` at the prompt. 
+ load a haskell file: `:l functions` where the file name is *functions.hs*
+ reload the current script: `:r`

## Boolean Algebra
+ `&&` means and
+ `||` means or
+ `not` negates a `True` or `False` 

## Testing for Equality
+ `==` means equal
+ `/=` means unequal 
but they can compare only the same type

## Built-in Functions
+ `succ` A
+ `min` A B
+ `max` A B
